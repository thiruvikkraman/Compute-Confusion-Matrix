# Compute Confusion Matrix
This repo consists of a simple code for calculating different metrics of a Confusion matrix.

Lets consider a simple 3X3 confMatrix and calculate with respect to second label (Class B). 

 --  | A |  B |  C
--- | --- | --- | --- |
A  | TN | FP | TN
B  | FN | TP | FN
C  | TN | FP | TN

## Metric
Precision = TP/(TP+FP) <br />
Recall = TP / (TP+FN) <br />
